# VULCHECK :lock: :ribbon:

***A package that implements my own algorithm to check the security of a password. :lock: :ribbon:***

## ABOUT :books:

Roughly a year ago, I implemented my own algorithm to check the strength of a password in Dart. ***Vulcheck*** is my port of this package to Node.js. ***Vulcheck*** is a combination of the words ***Vul***nerability ***Check***er. You can find the original algorithm [here](https://github.com/iamtheblackunicorn/securitycheck). Enjoy! :heart_on_fire:
